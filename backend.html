<h1>The Backend</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
The "backend" allows us to do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Know where our friends are (possibly restricted to a specific region)</li>
    <li>Let our friends know where we are</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This is achieved with "push" and "pull" queries.
</p>

<p>
A push query is any query that sends information to the backend.
A pull query is any query that retrieves information from the backend.
</p>

<h2>Regions</h2>

<p>
A region is an n-polygon that defines an area on the surface of the earth.
<ul>
    <li>The backend has pre-defined regions.</li>
    <li>Users can define their own regions. (push query)</li>
    <li>Users can edit previously defined regions. (push query)</li>
    <li>Users can see regions defined by other users. (pull query)</li>
    <li>Users can check if a specific region has been defined. (pull query)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Queries</h2>
<p>There are two types of queries: push and pull queries.</p>

<h3>Push Queries</h3>
<p>
A push query is any query that sends information to the backend.
There are two types of push queries:
<ul>
