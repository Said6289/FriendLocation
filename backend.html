<h1>The Backend</h1>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
    The "backend" allows us to do the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Know where our friends are (possibly restricted to a specific region)</li>
        <li>Let our friends know where we are</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    This is achieved with "push" and "pull" queries.
</p>

<p>
    A push query is any query that sends information to the backend.
    A pull query is any query that retrieves information from the backend.
</p>

<h2>Regions</h2>

<p>
    A region is an n-polygon that defines an area on the surface of the earth.
    <ul>
        <li>The backend has pre-defined regions.</li>
        <li>Users can define their own regions. (push query)</li>
        <li>Users can edit previously defined regions. (push query)</li>
        <li>Users can see regions defined by other users. (pull query)</li>
        <li>Users can check if a specific region has been defined. (pull query)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Queries</h2>
<p>There are two types of queries: push and pull queries.</p>

<h3>Push Queries</h3>
<p>
    A push query is any query that sends information to the backend.
    There are two types of push queries:
    <ul>
        <li>Location Push Queries</li>
        <li>Region Push Queries</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Pull Queries</h3>
<p>
    A pull query is any query that receives information from the backend.
    There are three types of pull queries:
    <ul>
        <li>Location Pull Queries</li>
        <li>Region Pull Queries</li>
        <li>Region Edit Queries</li>
        <li>Region Check Queries</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h1>Responses</h1>
<p>
    A response is simply what the backend sends back to the client upon
    received a query from it.
</p>

<h1>Protocol</h1>

<p>
    Clients communicate with the backend using the TCP/IP protocol.
    All communication is wrapped in UTF-8 encoded JSON objects. This means that all
    queries and responses are constructed using the JSON format.
</p>

<p>
    The communication happens in the following order:
<ol>
    <li>The backend waits for a query from a client.</li>
    <li>The backend receives a query from the client.</li>
    <li>The backend processes the query.</li>
    <li>The backend sends a response to the client.</li>
    <li>Go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
    All queries have the following JSON fields:
</p>
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>JSON Field</th>
        <th>JSON Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>query</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>A unique string that indicates the type of query</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    All responses have the following JSON fields:
</p>
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>JSON Field</th>
        <th>JSON Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>ok</td>
        <td>boolean</td>
        <td>Indicates whether the query was successful or not</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The rest of this section describes all the different types of
    queries and their corresponding responses in detail.
</p>

<h2>Location Objects</h2>

<p>
    A Location object has the following JSON format:
</p>

<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>JSON Field</th>
        <th>JSON Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>username</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>The username of the account whose location this object contains</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>longitude</td>
        <td>float</td>
        <td>The longitude of the account whose location this object contains</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>latitude</td>
        <td>float</td>
        <td>The latitude of the account whose location this object contains</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<h2>Location Push Queries</h2>
<p>
A Location Push Query is a push query that sends the client's current
location to the backend.
</p>

<p>
    The "query" field of a Location Push Query must have the value "location_push".
</p>

<p>
    The query JSON object has the following additional fields:
</p>
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>JSON Field</th>
        <th>JSON Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>location</td>
        <td>Location</td>
        <td>A Location JSON object that contains the updated location</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The response JSON object doesn't have any additional fields.
</p>

<h2>Location Pull Queries</h2>
<p>
    A Location Pull Query is a pull query that retrieves one or more
    locations from the backend
</p>

<p>
    The "query" field of a Location Push Query must have the value "location_pull".
</p>

<p>
    The query JSON object has the following additional fields:
</p>
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>JSON Field</th>
        <th>JSON Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>usernames</td>
        <td>array of strings</td>
        <td>The usernames of the account whose locations are being retrieved</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The response JSON object has the following additional fields:
</p>
<table border=1>
    <tr>
        <th>JSON Field</th>
        <th>JSON Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>locations</td>
        <td>array of Location objects</td>
        <td>The locations of the requested usernames as an array</td>
    </tr>
</table>
